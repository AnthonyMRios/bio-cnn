Human embryos commonly form abnormal nuclei during development: a mechanism of DNA damage, embryonic aneuploidy, and developmental arrest. What is the prevalence and developmental significance of morphologic nuclear abnormalities in human preimplantation embryos? Nuclear abnormalities are commonly found in human IVF embryos and are associated with DNA damage, aneuploidy, and decreased developmental potential. Early human embryonic development is complicated by genomic errors that occur after fertilization. The appearance of extra-nuclear DNA, which has been observed in IVF, may be a result of such errors. However, the mechanism by which abnormal nuclei form and the impact on DNA integrity and embryonic development is not understood. Cryopreserved human cleavage-stage embryos (n = dgdgdg) and cryopreserved blastocysts (n = dgdgdg) from clinical IVF cycles performed between dgdgdgdg and dgdgdgdg were donated for research. Fresh embryos (n = dgdg) of poor quality that were slated for discard were also used. Immunohistochemical, microscopic and cytogenetic analyses at different developmental stages and morphologic grades were performed. Embryos were fixed and stained for DNA, centromeres, mitotic activity and DNA damage and imaged using confocal microscopy. Rates of abnormal nuclear formation were compared between morphologically normal cleavage-stage embryos, morphologically normal blastocysts, and poor quality embryos. To control for clinical and IVF history of oocytes donors, and quality of frozen embryos within our sample, cleavage-stage embryos (n = dgdg) were thawed and fixed at different stages of development and then analyzed microscopically. Cleavage-stage embryos (n = dg) were thawed and all blastomeres (n = dgdg) were disaggregated, imaged and analyzed for karyotype. Correlations were made between microscopic and cytogenetic findings of individual blastomeres and whole embryos. The frequency of microscopic nuclear abnormalities was lower in blastocysts (dg%; dgdgdg/dgdgdgdg cells) than in cleavage-stage embryos (dgdg%, dgdgdg/dgdgdg blastomeres, P < dg.dgdg) and highest in arrested embryos (dgdg%; dgdg/dgdg blastomeres, P < dg.dgdg). DNA damage was significantly higher in cells with microscopic nuclear abnormalities (HdgAX (phosphorylated (Serdgdgdg) histone HdgA.X): dgdg.dg%, dgdg/dgdg; replication protein A: dgdg.dg%, dgdg/dgdg) relative to cells with normal nuclear morphology (HdgAX: dg.dg%, dgdg/dgdgdg; RPA: dg.dg%, dgdg/dgdgdg) (P < dg.dgdg). Blastomeres containing nuclear abnormalities were strongly associated with aneuploidy (Fisher exact test, two-tailed, P < dg.dgdg). The embryos used were de-identified, and the clinical and IVF history was unknown. This study explores a mechanism of abnormal embryonic development post-fertilization. While most of the current data have explored abnormal meiotic chromosome segregation in oocytes as a primary mechanism of reproductive failure, abnormal nuclear formation during early mitotic cell division in IVF embryos also plays a significant role. The detection of abnormal nuclear formation may have clinical application in noninvasive embryo selection during IVF. The study was supported by Columbia University and the New York Stem Cell Foundation. Authors declare no competing interest.
Genetics of triple-negative breast cancer: Implications for patient care. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined as lacking expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and amplification of the HERdg oncogene, often have a more aggressive disease course than do patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, including higher rates of visceral and central nervous system metastases, early cancer recurrences and deaths. Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a young age at diagnosis and both African and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, the latter due to three common founder mutations in the highly penetrant cancer susceptibility genes BRCAdg and BRCAdg (BRCAdg/dg). In the past decade, there has been a surge both in genetic testing technology and in patient access to such testing. Advances in genetic testing have enabled more rapid and less expensive commercial sequencing than could be imagined only a few years ago. Massively parallel, next-generation sequencing allows the simultaneous analysis of many different genes. Studies of TNBC patients in the current era have revealed associations of TNBC with mutations in several moderate penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, including PALBdg, BARDdg, BRIPdg, RADdgdgC and RADdgdgD. Interestingly, many of these genes, like BRCAdg/dg, are involved in homologous recombination DNA double-stranded repair. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of pathogenic germline gene mutations associated with TNBC and the early detection and prevention strategies for women at risk of developing this high-risk breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, we discuss recent the advances in targeted therapies for TNBC patients with a hereditary predisposition, including the role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in BRCAdg/dg mutation-associated breast cancers.
Novel Echocardiography Methods in the Functional Assessment of the Newborn Heart. Echocardiography in the neonatal intensive care unit has led to improvements in our ability to assess the neonatal heart in health and disease. Advances in neonatal cardiac imaging have provided the capability to obtain quantitative information that often supersedes the qualitative information provided by conventional methods. Novel quantitative measures of function include the assessment of the velocity of muscle tissue movement during systole and diastole using tissue Doppler velocity imaging, and evaluation of deformation and rotational characteristics of the myocardium utilizing speckle tracking echocardiography or tissue Doppler-derived strain imaging. A comprehensive understanding of these novel functional modalities, their predictive value, and limitations can greatly assist in managing both the normal and maladaptive responses in the newborn period. This article discusses the novel and emerging methods for assessment of left and right heart function in the neonatal population.
Adding Protective Genetic Variants to Clinical Reporting of Genomic Screening Results: Restoring Balance. 
Genetic Determinants of PdgYdgdg Inhibitors and Clinical Implications. There is significant interpatient variability in clopidogrel effectiveness, which is due in part to cytochrome Pdgdgdg (CYP) dgCdgdg genotype. Approximately dgdg% of individuals carry CYPdgCdgdg loss-of-function alleles, which have been consistently shown to reduce clopidogrel effectiveness after an acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention. Guidelines recommend consideration of prasugrel or ticagrelor in these patients. A clinical trial examining outcomes with CYPdgCdgdg genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy is ongoing. In the meantime, based on the evidence available to date, several institutions have started clinically implementing CYPdgCdgdg genotyping to assist with antiplatelet selection after percutaneous coronary intervention.
